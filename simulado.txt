Answer : D

Dynamic Routing Gateways (DRGs)

You use a DRG when connecting your existing
on-premises network to your virtual cloud
network (VCN) with one (or both) of these:

* IPSec VPN

* Oracle Cloud infrastructure FastConnect

You also use a DRG when peering a VCN with a
VGN in a different region:
* Remote VCN Peering (Across Regions)

You can think of a DRG as a virtual router that
provides a path for private traffic (that is, traffic

 

that uses private IPv4 addresses) between your
VCN and networks outside the VCN's region.

For example, if you use an IPSec VPN or Oracle
Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect (or both) to
connect your on-premises network to your VCN,
that private IPv4 address traffic goes through a
DRG that you create and attach to your VCN. For
scenarios for using a DRG to connect a VCN to
your on-premises network, see Networking
Scenarios. For important details about routing to
your on-premises network, see Routing Details.
for Connections to Your On-Premises Network.

Also, if you decide to peer your VCN with a VCN
in another region, your VCN's DRG routes traffic
to the other VCN over a private backbone that,
connects the regions (without traffic traversing
the internet). For information about connecting
VCNs in different regions, see Remote VCN
Peering (Across Regions).

Which OCI service is the most cost-effective?

A. Archive Storage
B. Block Volume

C. Object storage (standard)
D. File Storage

Answer : A

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure offers two distinct
storage class tiers to address the need for both
preferment, frequently accessed "hot" storage,
and less frequently accessed “cold” storage.
Storage tiers help you maximize performance
where appropriate and minimize costs where
possible.

Use Object Storage for data to which you need
fast, immediate, and frequent access. Data
accessibility and performance justifies a higher
price to store data in the Object Storage tier.

 
Use Archive Storage (cold” storage) for data to
which you seldom or rarely access, but that must
be retained and preserved for long periods of
time. The cost efficiency of the Archive Storage
tier offsets the long lead time required to access
the data

Unlike Object Storage, Archive Storage data
retrieval is not instantaneous

30. A customer wants to use Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure (OCI) for storing application
backups which can be stored based on business
needs.

Which OCI storage service can be used to meet
this requirement?

A File Storage
B. Block Volume

C. Archive Storage

D. Object Storage (standard)

Answer : D

 

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Block Volume
service lets you dynamically provision and
manage block storage volumes

* You can create, attach, connect, and move
volumes, as well as change volume
performance, as needed, to meet your
storage, performance, and application
requirements. After you attach and connect a
volume to an instance, you can use the
volume like a regular hard drive.

* You can also disconnect a volume and attach
it to another instance (only same AD same
region) without the loss of data

* Block Volume is Always Free eligible.

* A. common usage of Block Volume is adding
storage capacity to an Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure instance.

* You must select a device path when you
attach a volume using the Console, it is
required. Specifying a device path is optional
when you attach a volume using the CLI,
REST APIs, or SDK.

* The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Block Volume
service always encrypts all block volumes,
boot volumes, and volume backups at-rest by
Using the Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES) algorithm with 256-bit encryption. (At-
Rest Encryption is securing data that is no
moving)

Volume attachment: There are two types of
volume attachments:

* iSCSI: A TCP/IP-based standard used for
communication between a volume and attached
instance.

* Paravirtualized: A virtualized attachment
available for VMs.

Volume: There are two types of volumes:
* Block volume: A detachable block storage
device that allows you to dynamically expand the
storage capacity of an instance.

* Boot volume: A detachable boot volume device
that contains the image used to boot a Compute
instance

 

31. According to shared security model, which
two are a customer's responsibilities in Oracle
Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)? (Choose two.)

A. Object Storage data durability

B, Customer data

C. Local NVMe data persistence

D. Physical security of OCI data center
facilities

E. Virtual Machine hypervisor

Answer : B,C

Oracle Object Storage is an inherently highly
durable storage platform. All objects are stored
redundantly on multiple storage servers, across
multiple Availability Domains, within a region.
Data integrity is constantly monitored using
checksums and corrupt data is self healed.

Data durability: the ability to keep the stored
data consistent, intact without the influence of bit
rot, drive failures, or any form of corruption.
99.999999999% (11 nines) durability means
that if you store 10 million objects, then you

 

expect to lose an object of your data every
10,000 years.

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage
service provides highly scalable, strongly
consistent, and durable storage for objects. API
calls over HTTPS provide high-throughput access
to data. All objects are encrypted at rest using
Unique keys. Objects are organized by bucket
and, by default, access to buckets and objects
within them requires authentication. Users can
use IAM security policies to grant users and
groups access privileges to buckets.

With Object Storage, you can safely and securely
store or retrieve data directly from the internet or
from within the cloud platform.

Protecting Data on NVMe Devices:
s.cloud.oracle.com

us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/nvmedevice
information.htm

Some instance shapes in Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure include locally attached NVMe
devices (Local NVMe). These devices provide

 

extremely low latency, high performance block
storage that is ideal for big data, OLTP, and any
other workload that can benefit from high-
performance block storage.

Note that these devices are not protected in any
way; they are individual devices locally installed
fon your instance. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
does not take images, back up, or use RAID or
any other methods to protect the data on NVMe
devices. It is your responsibilty to protect and
manage the durability the data on these devices.

y%20and%20Access%20Management%20servi
se

Resource: cloud objects For example: compute
instances, block storage volumes, virtual cloud
networks (VCNs), subnets, route tables, etc

User: individual employee or system. End users of
your application are not typically IAM users.

Users have one or more IAM credentials

Group: A collection of users who all need the
same type of access to a particular set of
resources or compartment.

Dynamic Group: A special type of group that
contains resources (such as compute instances)
that match rules that you define (thus the
membership can change dynamically as matching

resources are created or deleted). These
instances act as "principal" actors and can make
API calls to services according to policies that
you write for the dynamic group.

Network Source:
A group of IP addresses that are allowed to
access resources in your tenancy. The IP
addresses can be public IP addresses or IP
addresses from a VCN within your tenancy.

Compartment: A collection of related resources.

Tenancy: The root compartment that contains all
of your organization's Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

Policy: A document that specifies who can access
which resources, and how. Access is granted at
the group and compartment level, which means
you can write a policy that gives a group a
specific type of access within a specific
compartment, or to the tenancy itself

Home Region: The region where your 1AM
resources reside

Federation: A relationship that an administrator
configures between an identity provider and a
service provider.

Authentication and Authorization
Each service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
integrates with IAM for authentication and
authorization, for all interfaces (the Console, SDK
or CLI, and REST API),

An administrator in your organization needs to
set up groups , compartments , and policies that
control which users can access which services,
which resources, and the type of access.

73. Which is NOT considered a security resource
within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure?

A. Network Security Group
B. Web Application Firewall (WAF)
C File Storage service

D. Security

Answer :

 

A security list consists of a set of ingress and egress
security rules that apply to all the VNICs in any subnet
that the security list is associated with. This means
that all the VNICs in a given subnet are subject to
the same set of security lists

A network security group (NSG) provides a virtual
firewall for a set of cloud resources that all have
the same security posture. For example: a group
of Compute instances that all perform the same
tasks and thus all need to use the same set of
ports.

An NSG consists of two types of items:

    1.VNICs: One or more VNICs, Virtual Network
    Interface Card (for example,  the VNICs attached to 
    the set of Compute instances that all have the same 
    security posture). All the VNICs must be in the VCN 
    that the NSG belongs to.  Also see Comparison of Security 
    Lists and Network Security Groups.

    2.Security rules Security rules that define the
    types of traffic allowed in and out of the VNICs 
    in the group. For example: ingress TCP port 22 SSH 
    traffic from a particular source. Unlike with Security 
    List, the VCN does not have a default NSGs. Also, the 
    NSGs you create are initially empty. They have no 
    default security rules.

One question for MFA:

Mult-factor authentication is a method of
authentication that requires the use of more than
fone factor to verify a user's identity

With MFA enabled in the IAM service, when a
user signs in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, they
are prompted for their user name and password,
which is the first factor (something that they
know). The user is then prompted to provide a
second verification code from a registered MFA
device, which is the second factor (something
that they have). The two factors work together,
1g an extra layer of security to verify the
identity and complete the sign-in process.

The IAM service supports two-factor
authentication using a password (first factor) and
a device that can generate a time-based one-time
password (TOTP) (second factor).

OBJECT STORAGE
Object Storage is a storage architecture that
allows you to store and manage data as

objects. Data files can be of any type and up to
50 GB in size.

Use Object Storage when you want to
store a very large amount of data that does not
change very frequently. Some typical use

cases for Object Storage include data backup, file
sharing, and storing unstructured data

like logs and sensor-generated data.
